        As an Undergraduate Researcher at the University of Michigan, I focused on advancing the
        performance of FPGA circuits and optimizing algorithms for particle detection. My
        responsibilities included conducting thermal tests for muon spectrometer electronics and
        refining the isolation scale factor algorithm to improve photon identification. This role
        allowed me to develop critical skills in VHDL programming and thermal analysis.

        At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I focused on advanced modeling techniques to
        enhance photon temperature estimation and diagnostics. My work involved developing Bayesian
        estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo models in MATLAB, alongside analyzing X-ray spectra
        from relativistic electron plasmas to improve understanding of photon energy distributions
        in laser wakefield acceleration experiments.

        During my internship at CERN, I played a pivotal role in analyzing the associate top quark
        pair production of the Higgs Boson. I handled extensive data sets, utilizing C++ and Python
        to process both real data and Monte Carlo simulations. My work involved applying statistical
        analysis and machine learning techniques to minimize background uncertainties, ultimately
        improving the accuracy of Higgs Boson signal measurements.
